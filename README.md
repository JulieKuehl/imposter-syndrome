# Imposter Syndrome [and Diversity Speaker Outreach]
This is a workshop for people who are thinking about speaking at WordPress events, such as WordPress Meetups and WordCamps.

We are keeping track of how many WP groups run the workshops this year. If you're planning on running it, please either [let us know here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/) or message @jillbinder on Slack.   **<span style="color: #ff0000;">This lesson needs to be created. Suggested we use ADA's Impostor Syndrome training at https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/impostor-syndrome-training/</span>** ------

## Meetup Description

_[If you are presenting this to a specific group, such as people who identify as women, optional sections to add are indicated in [square brackets].]_ Many of us suffer from imposter syndrome: we feel certain that we don't actually belong here, that we are not very good at what we do, and that at any moment, everyone else is going to discover our failings.  You aren't alone if you have these thoughts, and this workshop will help you understand the roots of imposter syndrome and how it is stopping you from realizing your full potential.  We will discuss some techniques for moving beyond imposter syndrome to being able to fully take credit for our accomplishments.  [We will also discuss why is more likely to suffer from imposter syndrome.] **_***You do NOT have to have any experience in public speaking. This workshop is for all levels of experience._** **This workshop is for you if:**

*   [You identify as <specific group>]
*   You think everyone else around you is far more skilled than you are at what you do
*   You’ve thought about getting up there to speak at Meetup or WordCamp, but are afraid you are not enough of an expert

**This workshop is NOT for you if:**

*   [You identify as <not specific group>]
*   [You don’t think it matters that there are very few <specific group> speakers at WordPress events]

**Agenda**

*   What is imposter syndrome?
*   Writing exercises to help overcome imposter syndrome.

**Accessibility**

## Screening Questions

A list of evaluation questions for students to see if they have the skills necessary to learn and understand the lesson. These can be used as pre-screening questions on Meetup.

*   For example, have you ever used WordPress?

## Teacher Notes

*   This lesson plan can be run alone or together with several other Speaker lesson plans. There are sections that repeat in each which only need to be covered once.
*   Have the group sit in chairs in a circle, or in small groups around tables for most of the sessions.
*   At the end when they are presenting their topics/pitches/outlines, change the room to presentation format (seats in rows facing forward toward the speaker)
*   After, encourage them via a sign-up sheet or follow up email to give their contact information to agree to chat further about speaking at an event. Emphasize that this isn’t a commitment, it’s an agreement to have further conversation about it.
*   Make sure the venue is accessible (ramps, elevators, etc.)
*   It is useful to have a large device that can show a countdown timer for the timed speaking presentations. An iPad would work.
*   The note about getting up and moving around whenever they want to is for accessibility for those who get antsy in their bodies.
*   [If holding the group for women: Don’t hold it at 9pm at night. Offer childcare if you can.]
*   [If you’re doing this for diversity purposes, have a person from that specific group lead the talk. Watch language, such as gender pronouns and transgender terminology.]
*   [ If you are running an event for a specific group, here are notes on dos and don’ts you will want to read: [https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/09/12/how-to-run-a-minority-only-event/](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/09/12/how-to-run-a-minority-only-event/) ]
