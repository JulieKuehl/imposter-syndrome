# Imposter Syndrome [and Diversity Speaker Outreach]

This is a workshop for people who are thinking about speaking at WordPress events, such as WordPress Meetups and WordCamps.

We are keeping track of how many WP groups run the workshops this year. If you're planning on running it, please either [let us know here](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/) or message @jillbinder on Slack.   **<span style="color: #ff0000;">This lesson needs to be created. Suggested we use ADA's Impostor Syndrome training at https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/impostor-syndrome-training/</span>** 

## Meetup Description

_[If you are presenting this to a specific group, such as people who identify as women, optional sections to add are indicated in [square brackets].]_ 

Many of us suffer from imposter syndrome: we feel certain that we don't actually belong here, that we are not very good at what we do, and that at any moment, everyone else is going to discover our failings.  You aren't alone if you have these thoughts, and this workshop will help you understand the roots of imposter syndrome and how it is stopping you from realizing your full potential.  We will discuss some techniques for moving beyond imposter syndrome to being able to fully take credit for our accomplishments.  [We will also discuss why is more likely to suffer from imposter syndrome.]
